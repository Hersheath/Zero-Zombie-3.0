    <h1>Zero Zombie</h1>
    <p>
      A terrible zombie virus broke out in B city, and the air force were
      dispatched to clean it up. Try your best, don't let the zombies escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the Arrow Keys or the Cursor (using cursor is much easier) to
      control the plane and press Spacebar to drop the bomb.
    </p>

    <button id="map1">Map1</button>
    <button id="map2">Map2</button>
    <p>
      Note: Not only the hailstone can damage your plane, zombie can also crash
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also airdrops to collect for ammo and HP.
